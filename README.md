# Cuchanoble-Android
Android app for the Cuchanoble project.

## What is Cuchanoble?
Cuchanoble is a hackathon project from 2017. It had the intention of being a small social network that connected the Animal Protection Department of the government of the city of Rio Gallegos (Province of Santa Cruz, Argentina), with potential dog adopters.

## Is it still in development?
The development is certainly on hold, since 2018. It is a great idea of a project. However, the government of the city has changed, and some parts of the project are deprecated, e.g. the backend part made with Django, Python. With the right motivation, this project can easily be put back on the development tracks. If you are interested in helping, please let me know! I'll be happy to start this again.

## Technologies used
The backend was made in Python Django, and an alpha version got to be hosted using Heroku. In the mobile part, it was only going to be released for Android first, I was the only programmer in the team, and had (still don't) no access to a Mac laptop/PC to work on an iPhone app.

## Want to help?
As I mentioned earlier, although the project is stopped, there's little reasons why not to keep this going. I'd be great to put it back on tracks again, maybe as a kickstarter for something bigger.

Let me know if you want to work on this! We'll surely find a team.
